# Cargo-audit ignored advisories documentation
# 
# This file documents the security advisories that are ignored in the pre-commit hook.
# The actual ignoring is done via command-line flags in devenv.nix:
#   cargo audit --ignore RUSTSEC-2023-0071 --ignore RUSTSEC-20.5.0436
#
# This file serves as documentation for why these advisories are ignored.

# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa 0.9.9 - Marvin Attack timing side-channel
# 
# Justification:
# - This is a transitive dependency through sqlx-mysql 0.8.6
# - The advisory states "No fixed upgrade is available!" for rsa 0.9.9
# - While rsa 0.10.0-rc.10 exists, it's a release candidate and may not be
#   compatible with sqlx 0.8.x
# - The vulnerability is medium severity (5.9) and is a timing side-channel
#   attack, which requires specific conditions to exploit
# - We are not directly using RSA; it's only used by sqlx for MySQL connections
# - This will be resolved when sqlx updates to a version that uses a patched rsa
#
# Action items:
# - Monitor sqlx releases for updates that fix this
# - Consider upgrading to sqlx 0.9.x when it becomes stable if it fixes this
# - Review if MySQL support is actually needed; if not, remove it to eliminate the dependency

# RUSTSEC-20.5.0436: paste 1.0.15 - unmaintained
#
# Justification:
# - This is a transitive dependency through rmp and parquet
# - It's marked as unmaintained but not as vulnerable
# - The crate is still functional and widely used
# - We will monitor for alternatives or updates from upstream dependencies
#
# Action items:
# - Monitor rmp and parquet for updates that use maintained alternatives
# - Consider alternatives if security issues are discovered
