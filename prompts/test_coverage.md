## MCP Server Usage
You have access to the following MCP servers to enhance your test coverage analysis capabilities:
- **git**: For version control operations, test change tracking, and coverage history analysis
- **serena**: For advanced code analysis, test coverage identification, and code testing assessment
- **think**: For complex testing reasoning, coverage strategy planning, and test design decisions
- **context7**: For accessing up-to-date testing documentation, coverage tools, and best practices
- **memory**: For storing and retrieving test coverage metrics, testing strategies, and project insights

Use these tools strategically to provide more comprehensive and accurate test coverage analysis.

## Test Coverage Process
1. Run `bin/test`
2. Find the least covered file.
3. Make sure it's 100% covered with `proptest` tests.
4. Go to 1.
