# Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

## Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

## Usage with AI Agents

- **Exclusivity**: AI agents **MUST** use `bd` commands for all task creation, updates, and completion. Existing task/todo tools (e.g., `todo_write`) are **PROHIBITED** for managing project tasks.
- **Workflow**: Agents should follow the standard `bd` workflow:
  1. Check for ready work: `bd ready --json`
  2. Claim your task: `bd update <id> --status in_progress --json`
  3. Work on it: Implement, test, document
  4. Discover new work? Create linked issue: `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id> --json`
  5. Complete: `bd close <id> --reason "Done" --json`
  6. Commit together: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes.

## Important Rules for AI Agents

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking.
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic bd commands.
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies.
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?".
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists.
- ❌ Do NOT use the `todo_write` tool or any other non-`bd` task management tool.
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers.
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems.
