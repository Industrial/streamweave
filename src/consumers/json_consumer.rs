//! JSON consumer module (not yet implemented).
//!
//! This module is reserved for a future `JsonConsumer` implementation that will
//! write stream items to JSON files. Currently, the module only contains placeholder
//! documentation as the consumer is not yet implemented.
//!
//! # Future Implementation

//! When implemented, JsonConsumer will:
//!
//! - Write stream items as JSON to files
//! - Support pretty-printing and compact formatting
//! - Handle serialization of complex data structures
//! - Integrate with StreamWeave's consumer trait system
