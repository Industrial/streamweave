We need to convert all existing tests to use proptest for better test coverage and more thorough testing.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Convert all #[test] and #[tokio::test] functions to use proptest\n- Use proptest generators for test data generation\n- Maintain test coverage of all existing functionality\n- Ensure async tests work correctly with proptest\n- Replace any proptest usage with proptest equivalents\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All tests in src/window.rs use proptest\n- [ ] All existing test functionality is preserved\n- [ ] Tests compile and run successfully\n- [ ] `bin/pre-commit` runs successfully (all checks pass)\n\n## Git Worktree\n\nThis task should be performed in a git worktree created in the `../` directory relative to the project root. The worktree should be cleaned up after the task is completed.\n\n- Create a git worktree in `../` directory before starting the task\n- Create a new branch for this task in the worktree\n- Perform all work for this task in the worktree\n- Commit changes to the branch in the worktree\n- Clean up the worktree after task completion",
